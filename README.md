# Pattern-Formation
Herein, you can find the following: Pattern formation (E.g. Turing, Gierer-Meinhardt) simulations and other assorted ephemera from the theory of dynamical systems. 
Some of this code was developed for a course I am teaching with my boss, Jonathon Howard, at Yale University: MCDB 361 Dynamical Systems in Biology.
